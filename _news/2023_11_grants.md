The lab was fortunate to secure new funding for collaborative projects:
* Together with Prof. Priori at UNIPV/CNIC, we will develop engineered heart-chips for testing RNA-therapeutics in the context of the EU/PNRR-funded National Center for Gene Therapy and RNA-based medicine.
* Together with Prof. Rizzello at UNIMI, we will develop a tuberculosis on-a-chip model to study the mechanobiology of senescent macrophages.

We also have several other proposals under review, so stay tuned for more news and potential opportunities with our lab
