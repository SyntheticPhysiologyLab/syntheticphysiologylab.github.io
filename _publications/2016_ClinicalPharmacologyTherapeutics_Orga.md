<h2> Abstract </h2>
<jats:p>A class of novel therapies leverages regenerative cell types in disease microenvironments. This complex interplay challenges established good manufacturing practices, as standards and analytical tools to measure regenerative potency are missing. That is, we can build the product right, but we do not know if we are building the right product. Here, we suggest that organ‚Äêchips, biomimetic <jats:italic>in vitro</jats:italic> phenotyping platforms, can serve as key quality assurance systems in regenerative medicine.</jats:p>
