<h2> Abstract </h2>
Acute myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure rank among the major causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Except for heart transplantation, current therapy options only treat the symptoms but do not cure the disease. Stem cell-based therapies represent a possible paradigm shift for cardiac repair. However, most of the first-generation approaches displayed heterogeneous clinical outcomes regarding efficacy. Stemming from the desire to closely match the target organ, second-generation cell types were introduced and rapidly moved from bench to bedside. Unfortunately, debates remain around the benefit of stem cell therapy, optimal trial design parameters, and the ideal cell type. Aiming at highlighting controversies, this article provides a critical overview of the translation of first-generation and second-generation cell types. It further emphasizes the importance of understanding the mechanisms of cardiac repair and the lessons learned from first-generation trials, in order to improve cell-based therapies and to potentially finally implement cell-free therapies.
